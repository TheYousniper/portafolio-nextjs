              My job involves creating and maintaining complete web applications, from frontend to backend development. This includes user interface design, business logic implementation, and database management. I use a variety of technologies, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the frontend, and frameworks such as React, Vite, NextJs. For the backend, I usually use languages like Node.js, Express along with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL or MongoDB. Additionally, I often work with version control systems such as Git and agile development tools to manage projects effectively. My goal is to create efficient, high-performance web applications that offer a smooth and engaging experience for users.
